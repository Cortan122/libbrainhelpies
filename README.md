This is my personal collection of small C functions/libraries.
Most of it is relatively crossplatform, if your compiler ignores unknown pragmas and supports c99.
It is designed for use with my [sfmake.c](https://github.com/Cortan122/voidrice/blob/master/.local/bin/sfmake.c) build script.

Works on my machine with **GNU**-Linux! (and sfmake only works on GNU... so far)

## How to use (i guess)

The files here are either [header only libraries](https://github.com/nothings/single_file_libs) or come in header-source pairs.
You can just copypaste them into your projects!!

## Variables

You can define the `PROGRAM_NAME` and `COLOR(a, b)` preprocessor variables, for some extra fun ðŸ™ƒ
